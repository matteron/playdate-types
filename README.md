# Playdate Types

A WIP type definiton library for the [Playdate SDK](https://play.date/dev/) and the [typescript-to-lua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/) transpiler.  

I've just been going through the [API reference](https://sdk.play.date/1.9.0/Inside%20Playdate.html#api-reference) and trying to add type definitions for all the methods and slowly testing to verify.

Currently only up to the `.display` and mostly untested.  Use at your own discretion.
